Hello! I am a senior student at Peking University, majoring in Electronic and Information Engineering. I work on None-line-of-sight imaging. My research interest lies in computational imaging and optics. I play with signal processing in the Fourier domain a lot, and I always love combining physical hardware and computational methods to create something.

# Research experience

## Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Imaging on non-planar wall 

*Remote Internship, Supervised by Prof. Andreas Velten, Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics, University of Wisconsin â€“ Madison* 		(2021/6-present)

- Independently implemented superposition algorithm for SPAD array without global gates, and interpolation method for irregular sampling grid;
- Joined a collaborative project in developing fast reconstruction for non-planar relay surface , responsible for algorithm and coding.

## Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Imaging System and Algorithm 

*Independent Research, Supervised by Prof. Chuanchuan Yang, Institute of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University*		(2021/1-2021/8)

- Mastered the theory of phasor-field virtual wave optics and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Diffraction (RSD);
- Proposed a criterion to explain the selection of virtual illumination function and corresponding wavelength in phasor-field method;
- [[Paper under review](https://arianagu.github.io/files/fusing.pdf)] Developed a fusing algorithm to improve the phasor-field method when the measurement SNR is extremely low.

## Holographic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Antenna Design and Optimization

*Independent Research, Supervised by Prof. Lingyang Song, Institute of Wireless Communication, Peking University*		(2020/6-2021/1)

- Surveyed the theory of massive MIMO, hybrid beamforming and reconfigurable intelligent surface;
- Analyzed the method of designing Reconfigurable Holographic Surface (RHS) by constructing varactor diodes in radiation cells to modulate the amplitude;
- Modeled a communication system with several base stations equipped with RHS, and applied fractional and convex optimization algorithm to suppress undesired side-lobes.
