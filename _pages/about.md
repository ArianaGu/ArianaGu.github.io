Hello! I am a new graduate student at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. [Laura Waller](http://www.laurawaller.com/). My research interest lies in computational imaging and optics and I am explorinig diffuser camera & microscope recently. I previously worked on None-line-of-sight imaging with Prof. [Andreas Velten](https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/). I play with signal processing in the Fourier domain a lot, and I always love combining physical hardware and computational methods to create something.

## Fast Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Non-planar Relay Surfaces [[code]](https://github.com/ArianaGu/3D-RSD)

**Chaoying Gu**, Talha Sultan, Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh, Laura Waller, and Andreas Velten

**Abstract**: Non-line-of-sight imaging methods reconstruct images from light captured off a relay surface. In most prior work this relay surface is a diffuse plane. It has been shown that even small deviations from a planar relay wall geometry quickly degrade reconstruction quality. Although existing methods can account for relay surface geometry in a straightforward way, they typically have high computational complexity and take orders of magnitude longer time to compute than state-of-the-art planar methods. In this work, we propose a fast algorithm that can perform non-line-of-sight reconstruction on arbitrary non-planar relay surfaces. Our algorithm has
the same computational and memory complexity as the fastest existing algorithms, yet it achieves comparable reconstruction quality to
the widely-used slower algorithms.
