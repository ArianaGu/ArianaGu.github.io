Hello! I am a graduate student at UC Berkeley, working with Prof. [Laura Waller](http://www.laurawaller.com/). I started my graduate studies in 2022 after graduating with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Peking University, China. My research focuses on developing and applying advanced computational imaging techniques, with expertise in signal processing, optimization algorithms, and their applications in image reconstruction and aberration characterization.

Previously, I worked on None-line-of-sight imaging with Prof. [Andreas Velten](https://biostat.wisc.edu/~compoptics/). I play with signal processing in the Fourier domain a lot, and I always love combining physical hardware and computational methods to create something.

# Projects

## Towards Full Field-of-View Fourier Ptychography for Extreme Ultraviolet Microscope
**Chaoying Gu**, Antoine Islegen-Wojdyla, Markus Benk, Kenneth A. Goldberg, Laura Waller

*IEEE CISA* 2024 [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10576262)

**Highlight**: 
- Extensively evaluated the reconstruction quality of existing algorithms under EUV microscope aberration. 
-	Achieved a 36-fold increase in the usable field-of-view from the nominal 5×5 μm² diffraction-limited area.

## High-throughput Diffractive Multiplexing Microscopy with Sensor Array
Kevin C Zhou, **Chaoying Gu**, Grace Jiang, Nicholas Antipa, Roarke W Horstmeyer, Laura Waller

*Photonics West* 2024 [[abstract & pre]](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/PC12857/PC128570A/High-throughput-computational-microscopy-with-diffractive-multiplexing-across-a-gigapixel/10.1117/12.3000876.full)

**Highlight**: 
- Developed a computational microscope using a sensor array and a diffractive optical element (DOE) to achieve high-throughput imaging, covering a 5 cm x 6.6 cm region with ~0.6 gigapixels.
- I mainly worked on developing the patch-based memory-efficient reconstruction algorithm that involves deconvolving a diffraction pattern to fill in the sensor gaps.

## Fast Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Non-planar Relay Surfaces

**Chaoying Gu**, Talha Sultan, Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh, Laura Waller, and Andreas Velten

*ICCP* 2023  [[paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10233262) [[code]](https://github.com/ArianaGu/3D-RSD)

**Highlight**:
- Proposed a novel computational method that effectively performs 3D diffraction propagation for arbitrary non-planar surfaces.
- Achieved orders of magnitude better complexity compared to state-of-the-art algorithms without quality degradation, validated on experimental data.

<!-- ## Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) Imaging System and Algorithm

*Independent Research, Supervised by Prof. Chuanchuan Yang, Institute of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Peking University*        (2021/1-2021/8)

- Mastered the theory of phasor-field virtual wave optics and Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Diffraction (RSD);
- Proposed a criterion to explain the selection of virtual illumination function and corresponding wavelength in phasor-field method;
- Developed a fusing algorithm to improve the phasor-field method which can improve the reconstruction SNR by around 20%.

## Holographic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Antenna Design and Optimization

*Independent Research, Supervised by Prof. Lingyang Song, Institute of Wireless Communication, Peking University*        (2020/6-2021/1)

- Surveyed the theory of massive MIMO, hybrid beamforming and reconfigurable intelligent surface;
- Analyzed the method of designing Reconfigurable Holographic Surface (RHS) by constructing varactor diodes in radiation cells to modulate the amplitude;
- Modeled a communication system with several base stations equipped with RHS, and applied fractional and convex optimization algorithm to suppress undesired side-lobes.
