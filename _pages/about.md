Hello! I am a senior student at Peking University, majoring in Electronic and Information Engineering. I work on None-line-of-sight imaging. My research interest lies in computational imaging and optics. I play with signal processing in the Fourier domain a lot, and I always love combining physical hardware and computational methods to create something.
