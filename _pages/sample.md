* [Fusion Paper](https://arianagu.github.io/files/fusing.pdf)

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging allows seeing through the corner by analyzing the scattered light off a relay surface. While Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD) arrays can enable the imaging system to operate in a parallel way and significantly save data collection time, most of the existing demonstrations still use single-pixel SPADs due to arrays' lack of global gates and little fill-in factors, causing low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). 32Ã—32 SPAD array has been used to track hidden objects, but there is still a gap in 3D reconstruction using large-scale SPAD arrays. In this paper, we propose a model to measure the credibility of reconstruction and design an algorithm to fuse the reconstruction results obtained by virtual illuminations of multiple wavelengths. This fusing algorithm can improve the phasor-field algorithm's robustness to low SNR measurement without sacrificing resolution, which is demonstrated on synthetic datasets. Our proposal can improve the structural similarity between reconstruction and ground truth by around 20%.
